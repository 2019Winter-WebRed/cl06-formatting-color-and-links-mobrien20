            <p>coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain coffea species. everyone loves a good type of coffee, but if you've never had it, how can you be so sure of what to order? the answer varies based on where you are going and what type of drink works for your taste buds. do you like sweet or bitter? iced or hot? let's figure out.</p>
           
            <p>so i first started off sweet 7th grade year, when i drank presweetened hazelnut iced coffee with added hazelnut creamer from wawa. then i tried an iced carmel coffee with cream and sugar from dunkin donuts freshman year and never went back to hazelnut. sophomore year i began to a snickers latte from brew ha ha which was a white chocolate mocha, hazelnut, and carmel coffee. now i'm a starbucks enthusiest and you can most likely find me any day,any time with a starbucks vanilla latte with blonde espresso or an iced caffé latte with almond milk, 6  pumps of sugar free vanilla syrup, and 6 shots of espresso. </p>
